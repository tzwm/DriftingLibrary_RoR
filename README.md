#Drifting Library

This is our Software Engineering project, written in Ruby on Rails.

The project has written in J2EE. That project can be found in my [Github](https://github.com/tzwm/DriftLibrary).

And the project also has a client for android which can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/cettco/DriftLibrary_RoR_AndroidClient).
